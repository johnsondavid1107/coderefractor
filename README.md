In CSS benefits lead, brand and cost were repetitive code so it has been renamed right-sidetextblock.  Same rule applied to h3 tag and img tag.

In CSS .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media.marketing all were repetitive code and was renamed to “look”.  Same rule applied to all 3 img tag and h2 tag


In HTML website title in line 7 can be updated. 

In HTML in line29 id= “search-engine-optimization” missing that should be next to class “search-engine-optimizaiton”

In HTML added alt tags to SEO line 29, ORM line 36 and SMM line 43

***Problem*** when web browser shrinks too much the text in the SEO, ORM and SMM flow out of blue box, can it resize? 
* Possible fix is to add overflow auto rules to CSS under .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, and .social-media-marketing.

In HTML line 67 there was a h3 class = header which added a box around the Cost Management header that seemed out of place and was removed.  

*** Why are there #id tags in HTML document?  It is not referenced in CSS at all. ** Answer** it is to reference the clickable links in the main section of the html.
